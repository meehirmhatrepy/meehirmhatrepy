## 📝 Publications

**“A Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network with Spatial Feature Fusion for Environmental Sound Classification”**  [📄 PDF](https://worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789811294631_0035)
Meehir Mahendra Mhatre, Li Zhang, Arjun Panesar — *FLINS-ISKE 2024 / World Scientific Proceedings* — 2024-07-30  
- Proposed a new Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) model with spatial feature fusion for environmental sound classification. Besides data preprocessing such as spectrogram transformation and data augmentation, customized deep networks, i.e. VGG19, ResNet152, and EfficientNetB0, with additional layers, are also proposed for audio classification. Specifically, the proposed CRNN model embeds ResNet152 and EfficientNetB0 in the encoder where spatial features extracted by both networks are concatenated. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) component is used as the decoder in the proposed CRNN for temporal feature extraction.

**“Modular Enhancement of OneFormer via CBAM-Augmented FasterViT for Semantic Segmentation”**  [📄 PDF](https://www.icmlc.com/technicalProgram/2025/FP/2011.pdf) *(In Pipeline)*
Meehir Mahendra Mhatre, Li Zhang, Stuart Rothnie — *The 14th International Conference on Machine Learning and Computing (ICMLC)* — 2025
- We present a lightweight enhancement of OneFormer by integrating the efficient FasterViT backbone with CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) for improved feature saliency. CBAM is applied after the encoder’s initial convolutional stage and at the pixel decoder’s input projections, preserving pretraining compatibility. On Cityscapes, our method achieves 77.18% mIoU across 19 classes with limited training resources, showing that hybrid transformers with modular attention can deliver scalable, resource-friendly segmentation performance.
